I debated putting this as my first blog post, then I decided I didn't care. Then I thought about trying to get a job and how most employers tend to react when they are informed that I have ADHD. Once again I debated writing this post all together. As I write this I am still debating it. 

Yes, I have a condition. Yes, it can be hard to focus. However, I work with a team of people to make sure that I can function, keep me thinking positive, and help me build on my organizational and productivity routines and habits. This team is really just a Psychiatrist, my spouse, brother, and some close friends. There is a 100% chance this will have an affect on my work but that does not mean it's a negative one. 

Focusing on tasks are easy when they are things that I enjoy, things that challenge me, and things that I think are truly fascinating. I will pursue these with great passion and in a field like Cyber Security with constant new challenges and emerging technology to tinker with focus is not an issue. If there really is going to be an issue is where the term *hyper* comes in. 

#### The Good, the Bad, and the Hyper

I am not going to run around my house or office screaming and freaking out like some sugared up child who cannot think straight; it's more like tunnel vision. I have **five tasks** to do, each of those five tasks have *20 steps* to complete. Start trying to organize that in your head and then your brain makes a connection from **task three** *step nine* and connects it to something from two weeks ago. That connection, the "Ah-Ha!" moment, is the next two hours of my life. 

I have built habits and tools to keep that from happening frequently and ways to break out of the tunnel. That doesn't mean I am perfect and that I wont rabbit hole from time to time but it's rare and generally doesn't last long before I realize I am off track. 

Thanks for reading, future posts will not be exactly like this. Some ADHD sure but mostly my projects, concepts, CTFs, etc.. Now, if you will excuse me I have already skipped lunch and I forgot to make dinner.

Endevouring Cyber Security Analyst currently working as a freelance physical security technician with High Tech Lock & Security. I work with low voltage security cameras and access control locks. When not working studying networking, cyber security tools, learning python, and participating in CTFs take up most of my time. I have been with my spouse for nine years, seven of them married.
